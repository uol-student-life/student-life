## Database Schema Migration (Atlas)

This project uses declarative database schema migration using [Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/).

All schemas are defined in `./database` directory. Refer to [HCL Schema Reference](https://atlasgo.io/atlas-schema/hcl) for more information.

To install the Atlas CLI, refer to [Atlas CLI](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started).

To apply schema migration in your local environment, run:

```bash
atlas schema apply --env dev
```

By default, atlas will apply schema migration to your mysql instance running on your `localhost` at port `3306` with username `root` and password `password`.

You can specify a different value by adding `--var host={} port={} username={} password={}` flag. The above command is equivalent to:

```bash
atlas schema apply --env dev --var host=localhost port=3306 username=root password=password
```
